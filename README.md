# EasyGSforBreeding
Because the audience asked for it so much. This is a simple step-by-step R script for GS for breeding purposes. I am using sommer but this can be changed by any other package and will be very simple.
 1) Read sommer package.
 2) Pheno --> phenotype data
 3) Geno --> genotype data
 4) Calculate h2 with the markers
 5) Spatial trends (A1 x A1)
 6) Calculate h2 adding spatial trends
 7) Extract BLUPs
 8) Adjust by different environments and extracts BLUPs
 9) Mixed model with GRM
 10) Calculate correlation

Side exercise for each trial: Cross Validation
